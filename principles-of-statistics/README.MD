Notes are compiled using pdflatex. Feel free to revise these notes, and any corrections are welcome - if you want to suggest any changes, let me know and I can add you as a collaborator on the project so that you can make commits.

Please note that the preamble is pointed at directly, so would have to be put in the same file structure (../../../preamble.tex) for any local version.
